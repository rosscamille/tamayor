#2. average temperatures in April for Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

#a. Creating a character vector for the city/town

#2. Create a matrix of one to eight and eleven to fourteen with four columns and three rows.

#a. What will be the R code for the #2 question and its result?
