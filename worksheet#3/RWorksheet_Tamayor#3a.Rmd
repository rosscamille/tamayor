## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#2. average temperatures in April for Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

#a. Creating a character vector for the city/town

city <- c("Tuguegarao City", "Manila", "Iloilo City", "Tacloban", "Samal Island", "Davao City")
city

#output
[1] "Tuguegarao City" "Manila" "Iloilo City" "Tacloban" "Samal Island" "Davao City"

#b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

temp <- c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
temp

#output
[1] 42 39 34 34 30 27

#c. Create a
dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using â€˜data.frame(). What
the R code and its result?
