1. Use the dataset mpg
A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables:
#’ \describe{
#’ \item{manufacturer}{manufacturer name}
#’ \item{model}{model name}
#’ \item{displ}{engine displacement, in litres}
#’ \item{year}{year of manufacture}
#’ \item{cyl}{number of cylinders}
#’ \item{trans}{type of transmission}
#’ \item{drv}{the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd}
#’ \item{cty}{city miles per gallon}
#’ \item{hwy}{highway miles per gallon}
#’ \item{fl}{fuel type}
#’ \item{class}{"type" of car}
#’ }
"mpg"
• Download and open the mpg file. Upload it to your OWN environment
#a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.

mpg <- read_csv("mpg.csv")

#b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
#. The manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class.

#c. Which are continuous variables?
#. The display, year, cyl, cty, hwy.

#2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
Show your answer.
#a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.



#b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
#2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the modeland the manufacturer.
#a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
#b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?
#3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and its results.
#4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result
#a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs shoudl have a title, labels and colors. Show code and results.
#b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
